        "Trees can be used in multiplexing datagram to efficiently route data packets to their destinations. One way to do this is by using a prefix tree, also known as a trie.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this approach, each node in the prefix tree represents a prefix of the possible packet destinations. For example, in a network with IP addresses in the form 192.168.x.x, the first level of the prefix tree would have four child nodes representing the values 192, 193, 194, and so on. Each of these child nodes would have its own children representing the second and third octets of the IP address.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a packet arrives, its destination IP address is matched against the prefixes in the prefix tree starting from the root node. At each level, the corresponding child node is selected based on the value of the next octet of the IP address. This process continues until a leaf node is reached, which corresponds to the final destination of the packet.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using a prefix tree for multiplexing datagram allows for efficient routing of packets with minimal overhead, as the size of the tree is proportional to the number of unique prefixes in the network, which is typically much smaller than the total number of addresses. Moreover, prefix trees can be efficiently stored and searched, making them a good choice for high-speed network routers and switches."
